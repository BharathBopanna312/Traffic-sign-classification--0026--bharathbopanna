Traffic sign classification project using deep learning
# **Project Title : Traffic Sign Recognition System**

##### **AIM :** To build and train a State of the art Neural Network model using Pytorch API that can recognize different Traffic Signs by just processing the images

Introduction
In recent years, the technology world is eagerly moving towards Artificial intelligence (AI). AI has many applications and one of these applications is autonomous or driverless vehicles. With the enhanced technology, multinational companies like Google, Tesla, Uber, Ford, Audi, Toyota, Mercedes-Benz, and many more are working on automating vehicles. There are so many algorithms to automate vehicles and too much research happens on daily basis. But before we think about these self-driving cars, we must wonder about how these cars automatically recognized objects like other cars, humans, animals, roads, and also the traffic signs on the roadsides like turn left or right, speed limits, no passing of heavy vehicles, no entry, children crossing, etc. and take the necessary step accordingly. Well, to recognize these objects like different traffic signs, we can develop an AI that is capable to do this kind of task.
Through this project, we will develop that AI which is a Traffic Sign Recognition Neural Network Model. This model will take images of the traffic symbols and returns the recognized labels of that traffic sign. The model will be a Convolutional Neural Network model that is designed and trained totally using Pytorch Library.

Why CNN?
In machine learning, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN or Conv2D) are complex neural networks. CNNs are used for image classification and recognition because of its high accuracy.

Why Pytorch?
PyTorch is an optimized tensor processing library primarily used for Deep Learning applications using GPUs and CPUs. It is an open-source machine learning library for Python, mainly developed by the Facebook AI Research team. It is one of the widely used Machine learning libraries, like TensorFlow and Keras.
